Learning JavaScript is easy.
Just follow the guideline!
Let's start!!!

---

# Basic JavaScript

---

## Introduction

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.

## Where to use JavaScript

+ Client

    In short, JavaScript can control the browser.

    In 1991, HTML came to public.

    In 1993, the first popular graphical Web browser, NCSA Mosaic, was released, which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web.

    In 1995 September, LiveScript was developed, since it is believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the Web page markup.

    In 1995 December, LiveScript was renamed as JavaScript.

+ Server

    In short, JavaScript can control the operating system.

    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

    In 2009, Node,js had been written.

## What to learn first?

> As other languages, the most essential things to learn are:
> + Syntax - how to write correct code.
>   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp" target="_blank">Read more.</a>
> + Variables - how to declare variables.
>   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" target="_blank">Read more.</a>
> + Functions - how to declare and call functions.
>   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

The other contents are also important. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">Just check them here later when you need them.</a>

Try to understand

```bash
callback
promise
```

## Improved scripts

ECMAScript, CoffeeScript and TypeScript may confuse you as a beginner.
Later in this guideline we will use example in `ES6`.

So if you want a fast start, then ignore the details of the rest concepts.
Knowing that they exist is enough.

+ ECMAScript
  ECMAScript 5th Edition(ES5), ECMAScript 2015(ES6), ECMAScript 2016(ES7) and ECMAScript 2017(ES8) are just different versions of JavaScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

+ CoffeeScript
  CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

+ TypeScript
  TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>
