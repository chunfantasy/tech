This note is about how to make a sexy terminal.

# Windows

## Msys2

Msys2 is the thing that I use to replace CMD in Windows.

#### Open Msys2 in Right Click Menu

1. Open Regedit
2. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell
3. Add (Default) -> Display name
4. Add Icon -> Display icon
5. Add command\(Default) -> "C:\Users\chfa\Development\msys64\mingw32.exe" "%V"

## Cmder

Cmder is used to make Msys2 look beatiful.

# Mac

## iTerm2

---

# Linux

---

# Zsh

Zsh works on all platforms. I just like the theme.

## Issues

### Why is a percent sign appearing before each prompt on zsh in Windows?

```
unsetopt PROMPT_SP
```

or

```
setopt PROMPT_CR
setopt PROMPT_SP
export PROMPT_EOL_MARK=""
```

To make this permanent, update your ~/.zshrc.
