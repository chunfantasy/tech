This note is about the problems that I met while using Web Server.

# Apache Http Server

## mod_proxy vs. mod_jk

### mod_proxy

1. Pros:
    1. No need for a separate module compilation and maintenance. mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http, mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy_balancer comes as part of standard Apache 2.2+ distribution
    2. Ability to use http https or AJP protocols, even within the same balancer.  
2. Cons:
    1. mod_proxy_ajp does not support large 8K+ packet sizes.
    2. Basic load balancer
    3. Does not support Domain model clustering
      

### mod_jk
1. Pros:
      1. Advanced load balancer
      2. Advanced node failure detection
      3. Support for large AJP packet sizes
2. Cons:
      1. Need to build and maintain a separate module

# Tomcat Server

# Nginx Server
